  All files of the folder will be listed, followed by any files that have the CSV extension.
  User needs to type the filename of the CSV file.
    On non-existent file, the user will be notified, and the program exits.
    Following the entering of the CSV file name, the main flow of the program begins.
The CSV file is processed amd all the policies are displayed.
Internally, each policy is stored in its own object, and a temporary list of them is created in memory.
After each line is printed, the actual maturity value of each policy is calculated and stored.
At the bottom of the list, there is a message prompting the user to comply. After he does, an XML file is generated, in the same
directory, containing the policy numbers along with their maturity values.
The file is named "MaturityValues.xml"
